# PowerPulse-Household-Energy-Usage-Forecast

**PowerPulse** is a machine learning-based solution to predict household energy consumption, helping households monitor usage and optimize bills while enabling energy providers to forecast demand and manage resources efficiently.

## Problem Statement

Energy management is a critical issue in today's world. Accurate prediction of energy consumption facilitates:
- Better resource planning.
- Cost reduction for households and providers.
- Promotion of energy-efficient habits.

This project delivers a predictive model using historical energy consumption data, actionable insights into usage patterns, and a framework for further energy management system research.

## Business Use Cases

1. **Energy Management for Households**: Monitor usage, reduce bills, and promote energy-efficient practices.
2. **Demand Forecasting for Providers**: Enhance load management and pricing strategies.
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Spot irregular patterns indicating faults or unauthorized usage.
4. **Smart Grid Integration**: Utilize predictive analytics for real-time optimization.
5. **Environmental Impact**: Minimize carbon footprints and support conservation initiatives.

## Approach

### 1. Data Understanding and Exploration
- Analyze dataset structure, variables, and quality.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and anomalies.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing or inconsistent data points.
- Parse temporal data and create derived features (e.g., daily averages, rolling means).
- Normalize or scale the data for model compatibility.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Select relevant features for predicting global active power consumption.
- Incorporate external variables (e.g., weather) if available.

### 4. Model Selection and Training
- Train models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Metrics: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared (R²).
- Compare and select the best-performing model.
